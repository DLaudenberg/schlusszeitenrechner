# Schlusszeitenrechner
 
A simple Webpage to calculate your end-of-work time.

## Usage

It's really simple! Just enter
- your starttime (i.e. when you started working)
- your over- or undertime (maybe you stayed longer yesterday or you had to leave early? Differentiated by the checkmark)
- and the duration of your break.

The Schlusszeitenrechner will immediately tell you when you will have finished your eight-hours-duty today.

_The time is rounded to quarter hours and is noted in minutes - so a quarter hour is "0:15"._
